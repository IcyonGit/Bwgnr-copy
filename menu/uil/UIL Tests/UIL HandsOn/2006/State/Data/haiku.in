Just two.
Now we have nine syllables.
Not really, but hard to estimate.
This line is really long but we need to have twenty syllables.

One.
Two.
Oh, wait.
That is not right.
My math may be off now.
First line had two and the next had one.
Now I need eighteen but this line is too short.

I.
U.
Now we.
Add love.
Becomes three.

Slow.
Faster.
Go faster!
Oh, almost there!
It's fun to play on the swings.

Okay.
A is three and B is now nine.
So this line should be twelve syllables.
This line should have twenty-one, but it has twenty-two syllables instead.
But if it were twenty-one syllables, then this line should have thirty, but we are now still not a GFH.
