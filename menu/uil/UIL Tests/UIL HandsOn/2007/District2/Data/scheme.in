There was a young fellow of Wheeling
Endowed with such delicate feeling
When he read on the door
Do not spit on the floor
He jumped up and spat on the ceiling

Here is the church
And here is the steeple
Open the door
And see all the people

Star Light Star bright
The first star I see tonight
I wish I may and I wish I might
Have the wish I wish tonight

a cat
a dog
a bat
a log
a rat
a frog
that is great
now I eat
and now I am done
how about that

What rhymes with purple
Nothing rhymes with purple
Wait I just rhymed purple with purple
Oh well
