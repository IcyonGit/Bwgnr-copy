      <p>Your assignment is to write a Java program that simulates a computer 
        operating system performing event scheduling. When an application makes 
        a request to the operating system, the requested task or job is assigned 
        a priority level (some tasks are more urgent than others) and placed in 
        a scheduling queue to wait its turn to be processed. The job with the 
        highest priority is executed first, then the job with the second highest 
        priority is executed second, and so on. If a new job is added to the event 
        queue then it will executed according to its priority level.</p>
      <p>Your program should do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>:<strong> Create priority queue (job queue) 
          </strong> 
          <ul>
            <li>Create a priority queue and add 10 jobs. In the simulation a job 
              is represented by a random number in the range of 1 to 100. The 
              smaller the number the higher the priority.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: <strong>Run scheduling cycle </strong> 
          <ul>
            <li>The program simulates the scheduling cycle of the operating system 
              by dispatching the highest priority jobs while the random number 
              generator continues generating numbers and creating new jobs. </li>
            <li> Each time through the scheduling cycle the program should print 
              the dispatched job, the newly created job, and the jobs still remaining 
              in the queue.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: <strong>Empty queue </strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The scheduling cycle should stop after 20 cycles and then dispatch 
              the remaining jobs still in the queue.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
