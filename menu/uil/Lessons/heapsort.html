<h1>Heap Sort</h1>
<p>The heap sort algorithm is really composed of two parts...</p>
<ul>
  <li>Build a heap from the array to be sorted. </li>
  <li>Sort the newly built heap.</li>
</ul>
<p>A heap is simply a tree-like structure with nodes and connections between them. 
  A node may have 0, 1, or 2 child nodes that connect from beneath, and exactly 
  1 parent node connected above, unless the node is the topmost or root node. 
  A heap may be represented easily by an array if for every node at index i, it's 
  child nodes are located at indices <strong>2i+1</strong> and <strong>2i+2</strong> 
  (assuming the array is zero indexed). Then the value of the array at index i 
  is the value for that node.<br>
  To have a valid heap, two properties must be met...</p>
<ul>
  <li>The root node must have the highest value of the heap. </li>
  <li>All child nodes must have equal or less value than their parents.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
  <strong>Building the heap</strong></p>
<p>The first stage involves converting an arbitrary array into a valid heap. This 
  is performed through the use of a utility method called <em>Sift</em> (also 
  know as heapify downward). What this method does is, given a node and a position 
  in the array, cause that node to &quot;trickle&quot; down from a high starting 
  position to its final appropriate position within the array. It's easy to see 
  that this procedure greatly eases the task of building and maintain a heap. 
  All one need do is call <em>Sift</em> for every array element and the array 
  becomes a heap.</p>
<p><strong>The Sift method</strong></p>
<p> The Sift method performs two basic functions within a loop... </p>
<ul>
  <li>Test to see if either child to the current node is larger. </li>
  <li>Swap the current node with the larger child. </li>
</ul>
<p>The loop exits when either the node has reached the bottom of the array (there 
  are no more children beneath it) or no child of the node has a greater value.</p>
<p><strong>Sorting the heap</strong></p>
<p>Once an array has been transformed into a heap, sorting the array actually 
  becomes trivial and requires only two simple steps...</p>
<ul>
  <li> Swap the last node with the root, thereby placing the largest value node 
    at the bottom of the array. </li>
  <li>Use the <em>Sift</em> method to move the new root node down to its proper 
    place.</li>
</ul>
<p>These steps are repeated for smaller and smaller upper portions of the array 
  until the array is fully sorted. The visualization applet below helps to demonstrate 
  how each of the two steps, building the heap, and sorting the heap, takes a 
  time on the order of <strong>O(nlogn)</strong>. Consequently, since only two 
  stages are involved, the entire process also takes a time proportional to <strong>O(nlogn)</strong> 
  for an arbitrary array of n elements.</p>
